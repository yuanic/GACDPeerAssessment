##About
This repository was created for Courera's "Getting and Cleaning Data" peer assessment. This repo will provide an overview of how the scripts work and are connected.

## run_analysis.R
run_analysis.R consist of the code required to clean the raw data as defined in the CodeBook. The output results in tidydata.txt.

To start running the code, the raw data from UCI HAR Dataset must be extracted and made available in a directory call "UCI HAR Dataset".

## codebook.md
The Codebook.md file describes the transformation performed and resultant data and vairables.
